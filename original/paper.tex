\section{Background \& Summary}

Submarine cables are vital for global communication and power transmission but remain vulnerable to accidental damage and sabotage, with recent severe examples in the Baltic Sea with, for example, the damage to the EstLink2 power cable~\cite{navalnews_estlink2_2024}, and the C-Lion1 communication cable~\cite{euromaidan_baltic_2025}, suspected of sabotage and linked to geopolitical tensions.

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology allows repurposing of standard optical fibers into dense acoustic sensor arrays capable of capturing vibrations and strain over tens of kilometers. In the context of submarine cables, this capability opens the path to a cost-effective means of monitoring marine activity to prevent accidental damage or sabotage. Unlike radar or satellite-based systems, DAS provides continuous, real-time coverage, is largely unaffected by lighting or weather conditions, and does not depend on cooperative identification systems such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS).

Publicly available datasets enabling the development of data-driven algorithms for DAS-based vessel detection are scarce. Existing works are often limited in scale, or lack of properly labeled metadata that allow research in Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning strategies (AI/ML). This scarcity is particularly severe in specialized environments like submarine cables. Initiatives such as PubDAS~\cite{pubDAS2023} (the first large-scale open-source repository for DAS data) have demonstrably accelerated research by providing multiple experiment datasets for benchmarking and algorithm development. So, the number of publicly available resources in submarine environments are very limited. Some relevant examples in this scenario are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The DAShip dataset, by Huang et al.~\cite{Huang2025DAShip} (available at \cite{DAShip2025}).
  \item The MARS DAS experiment dataset by Cheng et al.~\cite{cheng2021utilizing} (available at~\cite{cheng2020mbari_das_data} with a \href{https://github.com/njlindsey/Photonic-seismology-in-Monterey-Bay-Dark-fiber1DAS-illuminates-offshore-faults-and-coastal-ocean}{repository at Github}).
  \item The MEUST DAS dataset by Sladen et al.~\cite{sladen2019distributed} (available at~\cite{sladen2019meust_km3net_das}).
  \item The HCMR+NESTOR+MEUST DAS datasets by Lior et al.~\cite{lior2021detection} (available at~\cite{lior2021detection_dataset}).
  \item The DAS4Microseism dataset, by Taweesintananon et al.~\cite{Taweesintananon2023} (available at~\cite{VPRD2H_2022}).
  \item The OOI Regional Cabled Array (RCA) Dataset, by Lipowsky et al.~\cite{shi2025multiplexed} (available at \cite{lipovsky2024rapid_das_ooi} with a \href{https://github.com/uwfiberlab/OOI_DAS_2024}{source code repository at GitHub}).
  \item The Valencia-IslaLink DAS dataset, by Spica and Gaite, which is distributed within PubDAS~\cite{pubDAS2023}.%, recorded in a telecommunication fiber-optic cable operated by IslaLink Holding Iberia S.L. and connecting Valencia to Palma de Mallorca. Data corresponds to the first $50\,km$ of the cable (the first $~10\,km$ are on land and the remaining corresponds to a buried cable about $1\,m$ below the Mediterranean seabed). 7 days of continuous data are available (from September $1^{st}$ to $7^{st}$ 2023).
  \item The Yellow River Delta Dataset, by Song et al.~\cite{song2024near} (available at~\cite{song_2024_dataset}).
\end{itemize}

\input{table-datasets-v4.tex}

Table~\ref{tab:das_datasets} shows the relevant characteristics of each of them. Except for DAShip, all these datasets are oriented to applications in the seismic and ocean monitoring domain without explicit labeling information that can support experimental work in vessel detection and localization. DAShip is a large-scale, annotated dataset collected for the specific purpose of marine vessel detection. It comprises 55,875 ship-related event segments, captured on a submarine fiber-optic cable, $8.5\,km$ long, with a maximum depth of $13\,m$ along the cable deployment (according to GEBCO bathymetry information~\cite{gebco2024}). It is oriented to the detection of vessel passages right  above the fiber optic cable, using image classification algorithms to identify the ships' wakes, to that it cannot be used for preventive submarine cable protection, as the detection happens when the vessel is already above the cable. Another limitation is that the data has been downsampled to $10\,Hz$, which has two main issues: first, this reduced bandwidth does not allow to exploit vessel acoustic signatures, which exhibits relevant frequency components in higher frequencies~\cite{Rivet_2021,Thiem_2023}; and second, it will be more affected by low frequency noise from temperature drift, and, more importantly, from the effect of sea waves and marine currents.

We can mention other properly labeled recent datasets which address event classification tasks, but in terrestrial domains, such as that by Tomasov et al.~\cite{tomasov2025comprehensive} that presented a fully labeled DAS dataset, including band-limited feature vectors. The fiber was $1663\,m$ long, and was buried $1\,m$ below the surface around a rectangular area in an university campus. The selected events included walking, running, longboarding, and driving, as well as potential security-related events like fence climbing, fiber manipulation, and opening/closing of manholes.

The \texttt{Marlinks-NS DAS} dataset we present in this paper addresses the lack of publicly accessible, well-annotated DAS data aimed at submarine cable protection applications, by defining two AI/ML tasks, one for vessel detection, and another for vessel distance estimation. The dataset provides a large-scale, machine-learning-ready collection of preprocessed spectral features and vessel metadata derived from a ten-day continuous recording campaign on a submarine cable. It comprises $74,771$ data instances (feature vectors) computed at $250$ channels in a relevant fiber optic range, each containing energy values in $100$ logarithmically spaced frequency bands, together with synchronized vessel distance % and vessel presence
labels, plus anonymized vessel related information obtained from AIS (type, beam, and length). By releasing this curated dataset, we aim to promote transparency and reproducibility in AI/ML-based DAS research while enabling the scientific community to benchmark vessel detection and localization algorithms under realistic conditions. Additionally, accompanying code has been made available at \url{https://github.com/UAH-PSI/das-vessel-detection} to ease the community in this research area to quickly engage in experimental work.


\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

The processing pipeline we applied for the generation of the dataset is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture}, to provide a full reference about the data curation process. All the relevant methods and modules are described in the following subsections.

  \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}


\subsection{DAS interrogator: Acquisition Method and Setup}
\label{sec:acquisition-method}

The submarine fiber optic cable was interrogated using a phase-sensitive Optical Time Domain Reflectometry ($\phi$-OTDR) system. This approach uses a narrow-linewidth, highly coherent laser that emits short optical pulses into the fiber core, where microscopic refractive index variations act as Rayleigh scatterers. The backscattered signal from each pulse carries amplitude and phase information that varies with longitudinal deformation in the fiber, that can be related to vibrations and acoustic disturbances in the cable vicinity. By measuring phase differences between consecutive backscatter traces, dynamic strain variations can be reconstructed continuously along the entire length of the fiber.

The DAS data were recorded using an Alcatel OptoDAS interrogator~\cite{OptoDAS} connected to a $28\,km$ ocean-bottom fiber-optic cable originally deployed for power cable monitoring. The cable lies buried between $1.4-7.2\,m$ below the seafloor, offshore Zeebrugge (Belgium), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:geographical-location}. The interrogator employs optical pulse-compression reflectometry, that enables distributed vibration sensing over tens of kilometers with meter-scale spatial sampling while mitigating fading effects due to low-intensity points in the Rayleigh pattern \cite{gabai2016sensitivity, Zou_2015, Waagaard_2021}.  with a gauge length of $L=10.21\,m$, generating $2774$ raw spatial channels. The raw differential-phase signals were sampled at $f_s=3125\,Hz$.

  \label{fig:geographical-location}
\end{figure*}



\subsection{DAS Preprocessing}
\label{sec:signal preprocessing}

In this stage, the raw differential-phase time series generated by the DAS interrogator are converted to strain. This procedure is very closely related to the interrogator design and characteristics, so that the corresponding modules are mainly provided by the cable operator. The operations carried out are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Amplitude scaling, to ensure consistent amplitude levels in $rad/m/s$.
  \item Spike detection and removal.
  \item Phase unwrapping to remove $2\pi$ discontinuities.
  \item Temporal integration and scaling to recover strain values in $m/m$.
\end{itemize}

This process ensures consistent, and physically interpretable strain signals across all channels.

Figs.~\ref{fig:energy-dt-map}.a+b and~\ref{fig:strain-silence}.a+b show two examples of the generated strain signals for scenarios with a vessel nearby or in the absence of nearby vessels, respectively.



\subsection{Metadata Processing: AIS Data Processing}
\label{sec:ais-data-processing}

\todojmg{Erick, revisa please las estadísticas de AIS que pone aquí.}

The AIS data provided by the cable operator included vessel identifiers (MMSI), timestamps, coordinates, course, and speed for 745 unique vessels with 64,417 position reports. A relevant problem when using AIS data is the unpredictable and typically low position update rates~\cite{emmens2021promisesAIS}. A detailed analysis on our DAS data showed that $88\%$ of vessels reported positions only every 1 to 3 minutes, which may imply a significant positional uncertainty. To overcome this issue, we applied a linear interpolation between consecutive reported positions at $1\,Hz$ position update rate. %, discarding trajectories with gaps exceeding $60$ minutes.
We did not have the possibility of a direct quantitative validation on the precision of this simple interpolation approach (provided AIS data was the only available source of vessel positioning), but the good results obtained (see Section~\ref{sec:technical validation}) served us a kind of ``indirect validation'', so that we did not require to apply more sophisticated interpolation methods~\cite{guo2021improved}.

After the interpolation process, we had over $1,200,000$ AIS position entries, which we further enriched with web-scrapped additional AIS metadata (namely, vessel type, length and beam) that can be useful in further studies or AI/ML tasks requiring information related to vessel type and size.


\subsection{Metadata Processing: Geographical+Bathymetry Data Processing}
\label{sec:geospatial-tagging}

In our DAS context, geospatial tagging refers to the process of assigning precise geographical coordinates, and depth or elevation to each sensed position along the fiber optic cable. In DAS applications, accurate geospatial tagging is crucial because it relates the distributed acoustic measurements to their exact physical locations along the fiber, enabling spatially consistent signal interpretation, correlation with environmental and bathymetric data, and the development of position-dependent models for event localization and propagation analysis~\cite{holman2025}.

In our dataset, each DAS sensing position along the selected cable segment was assigned precise geospatial coordinates combining information from the data owner (that provided the reference longitude and latitude of the submarine cable route), and the depth information extracted from the EMODnet bathymetry service~\cite{emodnet2024}. This combination resulted in a complete set of geospatial attributes (longitude, latitude, depth) for all the DAS channels, which provides a fundamental reference the in our geographically informed ML tasks using the \texttt{Marlinks‐NS DAS} dataset.


\subsection{ML Tasks and Data Balance Considerations}
\label{sec:ml-tasks}

In ML applications, maintaining a balanced dataset helps to ensure unbiased model training and fair performance evaluation. For classification tasks, balance in the number of samples per class prevents the model from favoring dominant categories. For regression tasks, an even distribution of target values enables the model to learn the underlying functional relationships for the full data range, rather than overfitting to the most densely sampled regions. However achieving such balance is often difficult in real-world scenarios, where natural or operational processes generate highly uneven data distributions, which is usually the case in AI/ML-based DAS applications..

The \texttt{Marlinks-NS DAS} dataset has been designed to support two complementary machine learning (ML) tasks related to vessel monitoring for submarine cable protection. The first task, \emph{vessel detection}, is formulated as a binary classification problem that is oriented to discriminate whether there is a vessel closer than a given distance threshold to the cable. The second task, \emph{distance estimation}, is defined as a regression problem in which the model aims to predict the distance between the cable and the nearest vessel. In both cases the required labeling information is derived from the synchronized AIS data.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{class-distribution/class_balance_1000_2000_3000_4000_5000_ship_channel.jpg}
  \caption{Number of data frames corresponding to vessels located at different distance ranges from the cable.}
  \label{fig:data-balance}
\end{figure}

To asses whether both tasks are representative and evaluate their statistical balance, a detailed analysis of the vessel distance distribution along the monitored cable was performed. Initial inspection of the ten-day continuous recording revealed strong spatial distribution nonuniformity. Fig.~\ref{fig:data-balance} shows, as a function of the sensor/channel along the cable length, the number of 10-second data frames that corresponds to a situation in which there is a vessel at different distance ranges. From the figure we can identify a cable section around $16\,km$ (channel 1565) that exhibits a relevant increase in the number of available data frames with vessels closer to the cable than, for example, $1000,m$ or $2000,m$, which are reasonable thresholds for the vessel detection task. As an example of the rationale for such statement, a Spanish company monitoring submarine cables with AIS, establishes a $1000\,m$ distance threshold to trigger enhanced vessel tracking to assess potential threats to the cable.

This region corresponds to the location of the cross between the submarine cable and a dredged channel (approximately $20\,m$ deep) providing harbor access, which is consistent with the higher density of vessels shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:data-balance}. So, given this spatial data distribution, we selected a contiguous cable range of $2553\,m$,  corresponding to a subset of $N_{channels}=250$ equally spaced spatial channels located between $14707\,m$ and $17260\,m$ from the interrogator. This segment exhibits a reasonable availability of data samples, representative of both ``vessel-nearby'' and ``no-vessel-nearby'' cases, as well as a broad dynamic range of distances suitable for regression. The \texttt{Marlinks-NS DAS} dataset contains full data for this cable segment. Fig.~\ref{fig:histogram-distance} shows the distribution of data frames as a function of the \textit{minimum} distance of \textit{any} vessel to the cable, which shows the expected behavior (considering that it is not the distribution of vessel distances).

  \caption{Histogram of data frames available as a function of the \textit{minimum} distance of \textit{any} vessel to the cable.}
  \label{fig:histogram-distance}
\end{figure}

Finally, to give an idea on the distribution of vessel types, Fig.~\ref{fig:piano-distance-by-type} shows the distribution boxplots of minimum distances by vessel types, in which the top numbers ($n=\dots$) state the number of examples of each vessel type in the dataset.

  \label{fig:strain-silence}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
\label{sec:feature extraction}

In this work we carried out a data-driven methodology to decide on the feature vector composition, informed by available AIS data, and fully described in~\cite{ramirez2025vessel}. The main idea here is that we analyzed strain long-term  spectral averages of both vessel and background noise and found out that there were promising spectral differences between both cases in the range between $4\,Hz$ and $100\,Hz$. Additionally we discovered a strong spectral peak located at $100\,Hz$, with harmonics at its integer multiples, and one subharmonic at $50\,Hz$, probably due to the interference generated by rotating mechanical systems or electric noise in the interrogator environment. Fig.~\ref{fig:strain-silence}.c shows strain long-term spectral averages (in dBs) for the case of vessels closer than  $1000\,m$ to the cable (\textcolor{darkgreen}{\textrm{Vessels 1000m}} trace) and for the case of vessels further than $3000\,m$ (\textcolor{brown}{\textrm{Noise 3000m}} trace).



The strain signal for each channel was first segmented into non-overlapping windows of length $T_\omega=10\,s$, to which we apply a ¿HAMMING WINDOW? to avoid spectral leakage. The window size was selected to allow for a reasonable resolution in the few-Hz frequency range, considering that we wanted to avoid low frequency noise (mainly from temperature variations and surface waves). Thus, for each 10-second windows we run a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to provide spectral components for the feature vector build-up, selecting an initial bandwidth between $4\,Hz$ and $100\,Hz$.

The feature vector is then generated from the FFT values, so that each 10-second window is represented by $N_{bands}=100$ logarithmically spaced band-energy features within the 4--100~Hz range, excluding the 49--51~Hz and 98--100~Hz intervals. The logarithmic frequency mapping was designed to equalize the required spectral resolution, allocating more spectral FFT coefficients in the lower frequency region (the specific frequency band limits can be found in \href{https://github.com/UAH-PSI/das-vessel-detection/blob/main/data/fbands.csv}{the GitHub repository}).

The mathematical details for the feature extraction calculation follows. We first assume that $x_c^{(n)}[m]$ denote the discrete version of the $n^{th}$ windowed strain signal corresponding to channel $c$ starting at $n·T_\omega$ seconds, and that $X_c^{(n)}[k]$ is the $N_{\mathrm{FFT}}$-point FFT of $x_c^{(n)}[m]$, with $n\nobreak=0, 1, \dots, N_{windows}\text{-}1$ and $c=0,1,\dots N_{channels}\text{-}1$ being $N_{windows}$ and $N_{channels}$ the number of available windows and available channels, respectively. Each spectral band $b = 0, 1, \dots, N_{bands}\text{-}1$ is defined by its FFT-bin limits $\big[k_b^{-},\, k_b^{+}\big]$, where $0 \le k_b^{-} \le k_b^{+} < N_{\mathrm{FFT}}$.
From these definitions, the spectral energy of band $b$ for window $n$ of channel $c$ is computed as:
\begin{equation}
E_c^{(n)}[b] = \sum_{k = k_b^{-}}^{k_b^{+}} \big| X_c^{(n)}[k] \big|^2.
\end{equation}

Finally, the feature vector corresponding to $x_c^{(n)}[m]$ will be $\mathcal{E}_c^{(n)}=\left[ E_c^{(n)}[0], E_c^{(n)}[1], \dots, E_c^{(n)}[N_{bands}-1] \right]$, which corresponds to the $N_{windows}\times \left( N_{channels}\times N_{bands}\right)$ values available in the public dataset.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Data Synchronization and Labeling}
\label{sec:ais data and label generation}


Time synchronization between the DAS signals and the interpolated AIS information is carried out as a required step before data labeling is carried out. The interpolated AIS positions are then used to continuously compute the shortest distance between each vessel and every DAS sensing point. These distance values are considered within each 10-seconds strain signal window to determine the minimum vessel to cable distance used as the primary label for the ML tasks. This synchronization process ensures that all DAS feature vectors are associated with consistent, temporally aligned vessel metadata.

The closest distance continuous variable supports regression tasks directly as \texttt{Vessel distance labels}, or can be converted into \texttt{vessel detection labels} for the classification task, by simply applying user-defined distance thresholds.


\section{Data Records}
\label{sec:data records}

The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo~\cite{ramirez2024dasvesseldataset}. To simplify the dataset distribution all the data are stored in a \texttt{hdf5} archive (14 GB in size) with the following structure (summarized in Table~\ref{tab:dataset-content}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{X}: A 3D NumPy array of shape {($N_{windows}$, $N_{channels}$, $N_{bands}$)}, containing the feature vectors. XXXXXXXXXXX WHICH UNITS?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{{$N_{windows}=74771$}}: number of non-overlapped 10-seconds signal windows analyzed along the full recording period.
    \item \textbf{{$N_{channels}=250$}}: number of spatial channels (sensor positions along the selected fiber segment).
    \item \textbf{{$N_{bands}=100$}}: number of energy-band features per channel.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \texttt{y}: A 1D NumPy array of shape {($N_{windows}$)} containing the distance (in meters) to the closest vessel during each 10-second window. This continuous variable supports regression tasks directly, or can be converted into classification labels by applying user-defined distance thresholds.

  \item \texttt{datetimes}: An array of strings in the HDF5 file that records the UTC timestamp (ISO-8601 format) corresponding to each 10-second window, with shape {($N_{windows}$)}.

  \item \texttt{ship\_info}: A group in the HDF5 containing AIS metadata of the vessel used to generate the \texttt{y} label:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Vessel type, as a string value
          \item Vessel length, in meters
          \item Vessel beam, in meters
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note on Noisy Sensors}

Three sensors (indices 59, 60, and 61 in the \texttt{X} array) consistently exhibited high noise levels and have been forced to zero in the raw data. We recommend excluding these channels from feature matrices prior to training classification or regression models.

\section{Technical Validation}
\label{sec:technical validation}

Experiments described in our companion study were conducted using this dataset to validate its usability for machine learning. Two main tasks were defined: vessel detection (binary classification) and vessel distance estimation (regression).

\subsection{Dataset Partitioning Strategy}
\label{sec:technical-validation}


\subsection{Machine Learning Framework}
\label{sec:machine learning framework}

Two model families were evaluated: XGBoost and a simple feed-forward neural network. For detection, XGBoost used logistic loss with learning rate 0.3, depth 6, and 100 trees. For regression, it used mean-squared error loss. Neural networks employed three dense layers, ReLU activations, dropout of 0.5, and early stopping based on validation performance.

A 10-fold cross-validation scheme was applied, assigning each acquisition day to a distinct fold, ensuring no temporal overlap between training and testing. This design captures realistic generalization behavior for continuous monitoring scenarios.


\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The XGBoost classifier achieved an overall F1-score exceeding 90\% for vessel detection within 1000~m, with balanced class-wise precision and recall. Regression models estimated vessel distance with a mean absolute error of 141~m, corresponding to a relative error (rMAE) of about 14\% for the 1000~m threshold. Results improved with larger spatial and temporal contexts and plateaued for contexts beyond 50~s and 250 sensors. Neural networks performed consistently worse under identical conditions.

\subsection{Spectral Interpretation and Sensitivity}
\label{sec:spectral interpretation and sensitivity}

Spectral averages across vessel and non-vessel conditions show strong separation between 2 and 100~Hz, consistent with the spatial Nyquist limit for the 10~m gauge length. Peaks near 50~Hz correspond to environmental and electronic interference, which were filtered. Vessel crossings exhibit energy transients several minutes before and after the event, spanning more than 3~km around the cable intersection.


\subsection{Uncertainty Analysis}
\label{sec:uncertainty analysis}

Bootstrap resampling over folds provided confidence intervals confirming that the XGBoost model\'s performance is statistically stable. Variability across days reflects differences in traffic density and sea-state conditions rather than inconsistencies in data labeling.

\section{Usage Notes}
\label{sec:usage notes}

The dataset is suitable for classification and regression tasks under temporal cross-validation. Users are advised to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use day-wise splits to avoid temporal leakage.
  \item Report both global and class-wise metrics to account for imbalance.
  \item Consider spatial averaging windows of at least 1~km and temporal contexts of at least 30~s for robust modeling.
  \item Note that raw AIS and geospatial data are not available due to confidentiality.
\end{itemize}


\section{Data availability}
\label{sec:data-availability}

The data is avaliable in a open Zenodo repository~\cite{ramirez2024dasvesseldataset} (\url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15611778}) and it has been released under a Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International license for research and educational purposes, aimed to enable reproducible development and benchmarking of machine-learning models for vessel detection and vessel distance estimation in submarine cable protection applications.

The Zenodo repository contains the data stored in hdf5 format, and supporting documentation.
