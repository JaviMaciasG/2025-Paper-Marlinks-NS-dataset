    abstract = {During the past few years, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has become an invaluable tool for recording high‐fidelity seismic wavefields with great spatiotemporal resolutions. However, the considerable amount of data generated during DAS experiments limits their distribution with the broader scientific community. Such a bottleneck inherently slows down the pursuit of new scientific discoveries in geosciences. Here, we introduce PubDAS—the first large‐scale open‐source repository where several DAS datasets from multiple experiments are publicly shared. PubDAS currently hosts eight datasets covering a variety of geological settings (e.g., urban centers, underground mines, and seafloor), spanning from several days to several years, offering both continuous and triggered active source recordings, and totaling up to ∼90 TB of data. This article describes these datasets, their metadata, and how to access and download them. Some of these datasets have only been shallowly explored, leaving the door open for new discoveries in Earth sciences and beyond.},

  abstract  = {Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) leverages an ocean-bottom telecommunication fiber-optic cable into a densely sampled array of strain sensors. We demonstrate DAS applications to passive acoustic monitoring through an experiment on a submarine fiber-optic cable in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway. We find that DAS can measure many types of signals in the frequency range from 0.01 to 20 Hz generated by dynamics in the atmosphere, ocean, and solid earth. These include ocean-bottom loading pressure fluctuation of ocean surface waves generated by storms, winds, and airflow turbulence, shear-wave resonances in low-velocity near-surface sediments, acoustic resonances in the water column, and propagating seismic waves. We find that DAS can record high-quality low-frequency seismo-acoustic waves down to 0.01 Hz, which could be used for subsurface exploration. Using the shear-wave resonances recorded by DAS, we can determine the subsurface structure of near-surface sediments with low velocity. In addition, we can trace ocean swells back to their origins of distant storms as far as 13,000 km away from the cable. Because DAS is capable of seismo-acoustic monitoring with a high spatial resolution of approximately 1 m over a cable of approximately 100 km long and with a broadband sensitivity down to 0.01 Hz on the low end, it can deliver great scientific value to the ocean observation and geophysics community.},

  note      = {Abstract Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a recent instrumental approach allowing the conversion of fiber-optic cables into dense arrays of acoustic sensors. This technology is attractive in marine environments where instrumentation is difficult to implement. A promising application is the monitoring of environmental and anthropic noise, leveraging existing telecommunication cables on the seafloor. We assess the ability of DAS to monitor such noise using a 41.5 km-long cable offshore of Toulon, France, focusing on a known and localized source. We analyze the noise emitted by the same tanker cruising above the cable, first 5.8 km offshore in 85 m deep bathymetry, and then 20 km offshore, where the seafloor is at a depth of 2000 m. The spectral analysis, the Doppler shift, and the apparent velocity of the acoustic waves striking the fiber allow us to separate the ship radiated noise from other noise. At 85 m water depth, the signal-to-noise ratio is high, and the trajectory of the boat is recovered with beamforming analysis. At 2000 m water depth, although the acoustic signal of the ship is more attenuated, signals below 50 Hz are detected. These results confirm the potential of DAS applied to seafloor cables for remote monitoring of acoustic noise even at intermediate depth.},

Background on Ship Detection Using Machine Learning: While not directly applying ML, the study integrates signal processing and novel methodologies (e.g., persistent homology) to detect and track vessel signals. These approaches provide a foundation for ML-based feature engineering and classification models. Machine Learning Applied to Submarine Optical Fiber Signals: Persistent homology and image processing techniques, such as Gaussian filtering and Otsu’s thresholding, are employed to enhance signal detection. These techniques can be adapted for preprocessing and feature extraction in ML models using DAS data. Other Useful Highlights: Demonstrates the feasibility of DAS for marine traffic monitoring, even with poorly coupled cables in soft sediments. Successfully localizes vessels using direct P-wave arrivals and travel-time inversion, achieving results comparable to GPS tracking from AIS. Highlights the potential of DAS for detecting "dark ships" (vessels without AIS signals), which is significant for maritime security and environmental monitoring. Discusses the challenges and limitations of shallow water environments, such as uncertainties in bathymetry, sound velocity, and cable positioning, which affect localization accuracy. Provides a roadmap for integrating DAS with automatic algorithms and edge computing for future ML applications in signal classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a new oceanographic measurement technology that exploits the physical sensitivities of fiber-optic communication cables to changes in pressure, allowing time series measurements of pressure at meter-scale spacing for ranges up to 150 km. The along-cable measurement locations, called channels, are evenly distributed, but the specific locations of each are initially unknown. In terrestrial applications, channel locations are often found by the “tap test” where acoustic transients are created at surveyed locations along the cable. For submarine installations, tap tests are inconvenient or logistically impossible. Here we describe a new method for submarine channel geolocation by comparing DAS signals to ambient ocean wave time series using a variety of cross-spectral methods. Ground truth data were derived from two remote sensing sources: marine radar (X-band) and shore-based cameras. The methods were developed and tested at two coastal locations and showed an ability to geolocate DAS channels to within 10 m at ranges of up to 3 km (radar) or within 1.0 m at ranges up to 600 m (optical).},

  note      = {1-s2.0-S0957417421004164-main.pdf AIS Data Usage in Maritime Applications: AIS (Automatic Identification System) is crucial for identifying vessels in navigation, environmental monitoring, and improving navigational safety. Applications include route optimization, collision prevention, and emissions estimation. Challenges with AIS Data: Noise: Significant noise is present in static, dynamic, and voyage-related AIS data. For instance, positional data and Speed over Ground (SOG) often exhibit inconsistencies. Equipment Quality: Variability in equipment performance impacts data accuracy. Issues include unstable Course over Ground and incorrect SOG values. Human Factors: Errors stem from incorrect data entry, equipment misconfiguration, and deliberate signal switch-offs. Applications Highlighted: Safety and Collision Avoidance: AIS supports navigational safety by enabling vessel identification and communication. Environmental Monitoring: AIS can assess adherence to environmental regulations, such as restricted areas or emissions tracking. Supply Chain Optimization: Predictive analytics using AIS enhances port management and facilitates automatic tax collection. Research Insights: Mixed-method design combining quantitative AIS data analysis (from the Port of Amsterdam) with qualitative expert interviews provides validation. Identifies systemic issues like incomplete tracks, data gaps, and the need for better integration of AIS with other systems (e.g., radar, geographic data). Future Directions: Addressing equipment inconsistencies and integrating advanced data filtering to mitigate noise. Enhancing the reliability of static and voyage-related AIS data for broader applications.},
